# TypeScript AST Parsing Evaluation

## Current Approach vs TypeScript AST

### Current Regex-Based Approach

**Advantages:**
- Lightweight - no additional dependencies
- Fast string manipulation for simple .d.ts files
- Works well for current VA Design System format
- Small bundle size impact

**Disadvantages:**
- Fragile regex patterns that break with complex TypeScript syntax
- Manual JSDoc comment parsing and cleaning
- Limited support for complex union types and generics
- Maintenance burden for TypeScript language evolution

### TypeScript Compiler API Approach

**Advantages:**
- Robust parsing of all TypeScript syntax
- Built-in JSDoc extraction with `ts.getJSDocCommentsAndTags`
- Future-proof against TypeScript language changes
- Handles complex types, generics, and quoted properties correctly
- Better error handling and syntax validation

**Disadvantages:**
- Larger bundle size (~2-3MB for TypeScript compiler)
- Potential performance overhead for AST parsing
- More complex implementation
- May be overkill for simple .d.ts interface parsing

### Bundle Size Analysis

Current approach: ~0KB additional dependencies
TypeScript AST approach: ~2-3MB additional bundle size

For Cloudflare Workers environment, this represents a significant increase that needs evaluation against benefits.

### Performance Comparison

**Current Regex Approach:**
- ~1-2ms per component interface
- Linear string processing
- Memory efficient

**TypeScript AST Approach:**
- ~5-10ms per component interface (estimated)
- AST tree construction overhead
- Higher memory usage

### Recommendation

**Keep current regex-based approach** for the following reasons:

1. **Bundle Size**: 2-3MB increase is significant for Cloudflare Workers
2. **Performance**: Current approach is sufficient for .d.ts parsing needs
3. **Complexity**: AST parsing adds unnecessary complexity for current use case
4. **Maintenance**: Current regex patterns work well for VA Design System format

**Future Considerations:**
- Revisit if parsing requirements become more complex
- Consider hybrid approach: AST for complex cases, regex for simple ones
- Monitor TypeScript language evolution impact on current patterns

### Implementation Notes

If TypeScript AST approach is needed in the future:

```typescript
import ts from 'typescript';

export class ASTInterfaceParser {
  parseInterfaceProperties(interfaceCode: string): ComponentProperty[] {
    const sourceFile = ts.createSourceFile(
      'temp.ts',
      interfaceCode,
      ts.ScriptTarget.Latest,
      true,
      ts.ScriptKind.TS
    );
    
    // AST traversal implementation
  }
}
```
